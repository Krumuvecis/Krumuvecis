## Projects

Some of my repositories are thematically similar, thus, in order to de-clutter, I've grouped some of them together using **Organizations**.
 - [KruMF](https://github.com/KruMF) - My Java-Maven framework for frequently reused features and tools.
 - [EchnatonsPub](https://github.com/EchnatonsPub) - Intended for publications. _(Work in progress)_
 - [EchnatonsGeography](https://github.com/EchnatonsGeography) - Geographical data. _(Work in progress)_
 - [Krumuvecis-tests](https://github.com/Krumuvecis-tests) - Test projects.
 - [Krumuvecis-old](https://github.com/Krumuvecis-old) - Old and deprecated projects.

Some repositories are not grouped, you can find them in this profile.
